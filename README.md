# Urban Meal Delivery

This repository holds code
analyzing the data of an undisclosed urban meal delivery platform
operating in France from January 2016 to January 2017.
The goal is to
optimize the platform's delivery process involving independent couriers.

The analysis is structured into three aspects
that iteratively build on each other.

## Real-time Demand Forecasting

## Predictive Routing

## Shift & Capacity Planning
